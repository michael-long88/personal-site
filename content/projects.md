## D&D Tavern Calculator
Orginally created for a D&D 5e campaign to manage earnings from a player-owned tavern. This tool has since been expanded to include: 
- a currency calculator
- a reference page with various tables
- an in-progress spell lookup page

This app was created using Vue.js, Bootstrap CSS, and FontAwesome icons.

## Debt Amortization
I designed this website as an easy way to see a loan or credit card breakdown over time. By entering some basic information, such as the loan amount, interest rate, and loan period, users can see a row by row breakdown of payments, interest, and even cumulative interest. When viewing from a non-mobile device, you can see an interactive graph or even download a CSV copy of the generated table.
