At RTI, I work with a talented team of data scientists and software developers to use data to present information and help make decisions. Before becoming a data scientist, I primarily used Python for data processing and Vue.js for the front-end. I've helped to create a number of dashboards for clients interested in seeing how data can improve their lives. During grad school, I had the opportunity to work on social media text data. My team used that data to create a network analysis, cluster the network, extract entities and sentiment from those clusters, and create machine learning models to predict thread length and thread duration.

In my down time, I enjoy learning and implementing new technologies, such as Rust, Tailwind CSS, or expanding my knowledge of the Python pandas library. I believe that technology and data can truly make a difference in people's lives and I look forward to employing my new and existing skills to do exactly that.
