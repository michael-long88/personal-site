Marine Corps veteran and data scientist specializing in LLM applications, machine learning, and full-stack development. I combine technical expertise with leadership skills honed through military service to transform complex data into practical solutions.

After serving 8 years in the Marine Corps, I transitioned to technology by earning my B.S. in Computer Science from UNC Charlotte (magna cum laude). I've since completed my M.S. in Analytics from NC State University's Institute for Advanced Analytics, further strengthening my data science capabilities.

At RTI International, I've built RAG-based question-and-answer tools using LLMs, developed NLP pipelines for medical subject tagging, and created efficient microsimulation frameworks for CDC projects. My technical toolkit includes Python, SQL, Rust, and JavaScript, with expertise in FastAPI, Vue.js, and containerization technologies.

I'm passionate about applying data science to solve real-world problems. Whether developing education transcript processing tools with LLM integration or conducting network analysis on social media data, I focus on creating solutions that make meaningful impacts.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring emerging technologies and working on personal, open-source projects. I believe in technology's power to improve lives and am committed to using my unique combination of military discipline, software engineering experience, and data science expertise to create positive change.
