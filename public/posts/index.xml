      <description>Creating a full-stack Rust &amp;amp; Vue app This is actually my first attempt at documenting my thoughts as I approach a new project. So, not only will I be learning the best way to write things down as I do them, but also how to setup a Rust backend using Axum and SQLx in Docker. What could go wrong?
For anyone following along, this post does assume that you have npm and Rust already installed.</description>
